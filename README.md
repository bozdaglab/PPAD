PPAD is a deep learning architecture based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It consists of a RNN and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). PPAD is designed for early predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the next visit for patients.
  
In this architecture, the RNN component learns ùë•ùë°ÃÇ, a latent representation of the longitudinal clinical data up to ùë° visits. Then, the MLP model is trained with concatenation of the cross-sectional demographic data (ùê∑) and ùë•ùë°ÃÇ to predict conversion to AD at next visit.

# Predicting Progression of Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Autoencoder (PPAD-AE)

PPAD-AE is a deep learning architecture based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). It composes of a RNN autoencoder and an MLP. PPAD-AE is designed for early predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) at multiple visits ahead for patients. 

In this architecture, the RNN component learns a latent representation (ùë•ùë°ÃÇ) of the longitudinal clinical data up to ùë° visits. Then, the latent representation is used by the decoder component to generate representations of multiple visits ahead up to ùëõ visits. Finally, the MLP model is trained with concatenation of the cross-sectional demographic data (ùê∑) and the representation of the last generated visit by the decoder to predict conversion to AD at the (ùë°+ùëõ)ùë°‚Ñé visit.

# Parameter learning and evaluation metrics

To increase the prediction‚Äôs sensitivity for both architectures, all trainable parameters for the RNN, RNN autoencoder, and MLP were learned in an integral way using a customized binary cross-entropy loss function to give more weight on predicting conversion to AD cases. We seek by using this customized loss function to minimize the false negative cases while predicting diagnosis of the future visit which leads to increased sensitivity of the predictive model.
  
RNN cell, number of epochs, batch size, dropout rate, and L2 regularization are the hyperparameters that have been tuned. For model evaluation, F2 score and sensitivity were used.

# Datasets and input format

We evaluated the proposed architectures in two experimental setups. In the first setup, Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset was utilized to train and test the proposed architectures using the longitudinal multi-modal and the cross-sectional demographic data. In the second setup, the models were trained on the entire ADNI longitudinal and cross-sec-tional data and tested on National Alzheimer‚Äôs Coordinating Center (NACC) dataset.
  
 - To get ADNI, you need to request an access for it https://adni.loni.usc.edu/
  
 - To get NACC, you need to request an access for it https://naccdata.org/
  
The training and test longitudinal data format is given where data is stored as a list containing 3 dimensionals tensors such as [number of samples , number of visits , number of longitudinal feature in each vist].
  
The training and test demographic data format is given where data is stored as a list containing other lists such that each inner list represents demographic features for one sample.
    
The training and test label data format is given where data is stored as a list containing 3 dimensionals tensors such as [number of samples , number of visits , 1] where the third dimension can be 0 (MCI) or 1 (Dementia).

Both PPAD and PPAD-AE sample dataset folders contain the following pkl files:

 - longitudinal_data_train.pkl which represents longitudinal training data

 - label_train.pkl which represents labels of traing data 

 - demographic_data_train.pkl which represents demographic training data

 - longitudinal_data_test.pkl which represents longitudinal test data

 - label_test.pkl which represents labels of test data

 - demographic_data_test.pkl which represents demographic test data
  
 # How to generate pkl files
 
 Although I provided you with sample pkl files, you can use pkl_files_preperation.ipynb with the following assumptions:
  - You have access to ADNI dataset https://adni.loni.usc.edu/, and you already downloaded ADNI_Merge.csv file.
  - You preprocessed ADNI_Merge.csv file (removing unnecessary columns, taking care of NAN and missing values, removing patient with single visit, and removing Normal patients).
  - you divided ADNI_Merge.csv into two files: longitudinal_data.csv and demographic_data.csv.
  - longitudinal_data.csv should have 'RID', 'VISCODEE', 'DX, and at least one longitudinal feature. In this file, each record represents one visit, so same RID can have multiple visits.
  - demographic_data.csv should have 'RID' and at least one demographic feature. In this file, each record represents demographic data for one patient.
  - All files (pkl_files_preperation.ipynb, longitudinal_data.csv, and demographic_data.csv) should in the same directory.
  - Open and run pkl_files_preperation.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook. You will be asked to determine the number of visits that you would like to use to train the model and the number of future visits that you would like to predict thier diagnosis.
  - For PPAD, the number of future visits that you would like to predict thier diagnosis is always one.
  - If the raw dataset you provid (ongitudinal_data.csv and demographic_data.csv) is not carefully preprocesses, you are going to get an error.
  - If the number of visits that you would like to use to train the model and the number of future visits that you would like to predict thier diagnosis can not be created due to lack of visits, you are going to get an error.

I provided you with sample of longitudinal_data.csv and demographic_data.csv which can be found in Raw data sample folder

After you run the the code without errors, following files will be generated:
 - longitudinal_data_train.pkl

 - label_train.pkl 

 - demographic_data_train.pkl

 - longitudinal_data_test.pkl

 - label_test.pkl

 - demographic_data_test.pkl
 
 # Compitability
 
 All codes are compatible with tensorflow version 2.4.1, keras version 2.4.3 and Pyhton 3.8.5.
 
 # How to run PPAD
 
 To runn PPAD, you have to have the following files in the same directory:
 
  - PPAD.ipynb
  - longitudinal_data_train.pkl
  - label_train.pkl 
  - demographic_data_train.pkl
  - longitudinal_data_test.pkl
  - label_test.pkl
  - demographic_data_test.pkl
  - hp_df.csv which represents values of hyperparameters that have been tuned
 
After you put all files in the same directory, open and run PPAD.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook. PPAD will be trained and tested five times and results will be generated as csv file with the following format (x_y_PPAD-AE.csv) where x means the number of visits that have been used to train the model and y means the number of future visits for prediction.

To change values of hyperparameters, open hp_df.csv and change values. The values should be as following:
 - batch_size: integer
 - epoch: integer
 - dropout: float number
 - l2: float number 
 - cell: one of these value [GRU, LSTM, biGRU, biLSTM]
